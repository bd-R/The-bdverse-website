`bdchecks` is an infrastructure for performing, filtering and managing various biodiversity data checks using R. Data checks are a key to promoting biodiversity data quality.

`bdchecks` offers various features for different types of R users:

* An interactive and user-friendly Shiny app for inexperienced R users.

* Full command line functionality for more experienced R users.

* Advanced R users can easily edit, add and manage their own collection of data checks, using one single YAML file and only two supporting R functions.

* Our first mission is to successfully implement all core suite of tests and assertions being developed by TDWGâ€™s Biodiversity Data Quality 'Task Group 2: Data Quality Tests and Assertions'. `bdchecks` core is designed to match the test structure, and we also developing and maintaining a synchronization system.

* Our second mission is developing a complete and easy app reproducibility, we're on the right track, and we'll have it soon.

* We've implemented an automated testings scheme that **continually** checks each test with numerous scenarios and reports any unexpected results. We designed it to be extremely easy and intuitive to add scenarios.

* We've developed a prototype for a management Shiny app that allows easy editing and maintenance of all checks.

* We're exploring different types of data checks, such as value-dependent checks (implementation is very soon), and even how to facilitate checks from external R packages.
