`bdclean` is a user-friendly data cleaning [Shiny app](https://shiny.rstudio.com) for the inexperienced R user. It provides features to manage complete workflow for biodiversity data cleaning, including data upload; user input - in order to adjust cleaning procedures; data cleaning; and finally, generation of various reports and versions of the data (flagged, and cleaned).
In order for `bdclean` to truly be practical, several unique and challenging R components were developed, such as **a questionnaire module** and **high-quality report mechanism**. Also, since `bdclean` was developed for the inexperienced R user, `bdclean` GUI is highly intuitive.
